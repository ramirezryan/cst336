                <p>Since virtual machines are capable of partitioning virtual resources for independent use, a virtual machine essentially becomes a computer inside of a computer. 
                The number of virtual machines that can be run on a host machine depends on the hardware specifications of the host machine. 
                Virtual machines consume CPU, memory, and storage space, just as a regular desktop computer would.

                <p>Virtualization and virtual machines increase scalability for services in the real world. 
                Since many virtual machines can be run on a single, powerful computer, larger businesses and government services can decrease the amount of servers needed to provide services, lower energy consumption, and decrease infrastructure costs.
